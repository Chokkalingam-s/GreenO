About Us
A sustainable environmental initiative that promotes afforestation by encouraging
students to plant and nurture a tree during their academic journey. The project aims
to instill a sense of environmental responsibility among students, fostering a
connection between education and ecological conservation. By linking each student
with the growth of a tree, the initiative contributes to carbon sequestration
biodiversity, and overall environmental well-being. It serves as a practical and
tangible way for educational institutions to engage their students in fostering a
greener and healthier planet. •one Student One Tree" embodies the idea that small
individual actions collectively create a significant positive impact on the
environment.
